Privacy Policy
Effective Date: April 24, 2025

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how Dustin Decker (“we,” “our,” or “us”) handles information when you use the Malicious Link Scanner proof-of-concept application (“App”). By installing or using the App, you agree to the practices described here.

2. Information We Collect

    Message Data: Text of incoming messages from Meta platforms (Facebook Messenger, Instagram Direct, WhatsApp Business).

    Extracted URLs: Any web links parsed from those messages.

    Meta Identifiers: Sender or thread IDs supplied by Meta APIs (no full user profiles or additional personal details).

    Usage Metrics: Timestamps and scan-count statistics for performance monitoring.

3. How We Use Your Information

    Threat Analysis: Forward each extracted URL to the VirusTotal Premium API for security scanning.

    App Functionality: Enable message parsing, rate-limit management, and error handling.

    Performance Monitoring: Collect anonymized metrics to ensure the App runs smoothly.

4. Data Retention
We do not store any message data, URLs, or scan results beyond the moment they are processed. Once a URL is submitted for scanning and the result is retrieved, all related data is immediately discarded.

5. Information Sharing

    VirusTotal: URLs are sent directly to VirusTotal for analysis under their own Privacy Policy.

    Meta Platforms: We do not share any data back to Facebook, Instagram, or WhatsApp beyond normal API requests.

    No Third-Party Distribution: We do not sell, rent, or distribute your data to any other parties.

6. Security
We employ reasonable safeguards (HTTPS for webhooks and API calls, secured API-key storage) to protect data in transit. However, no system is entirely immune to risk.

7. Children’s Privacy
This App is not intended for users under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under 13.

8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy at any time. The “Effective Date” will indicate the latest revision. Continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of any changes.
